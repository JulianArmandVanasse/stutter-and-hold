# Stutter+Hold
A timbral tremolo based on the phase vocodeur. The spectral freeze effect to prolong the tones of a single frame is extended through _Stutter+Hold_ to update the held frame at a regular interval.

## Under the Hood
The interface has been designed so that any interested party can add the plug-in to their library and get started immediately with this novel effect, regardless of prior knowledge of audio processing. But, for interested parties this section outlines the tools at play and some innovations by the developers.

### Phase Vocodeur
Essential to this effect is a framework for making local estimates of frequency content in the signal and modifying the signal based on these estimates. The estimation process is known in DSP literature as the _Analysis_ stage, and the modification process as the _Synthesis_ stage.  The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Wavelets and the elusive Matching Pursuit are various techniques for implementing this two stage process, but the most common technique used in real-time audio signal processing is the use of the STFT. An alternative name is the [Phase Vocodeur](https://cycling74.com/tutorials/the-phase-vocoder-%E2%80%93-part-i), and linked here to a great introduction to this process in the Max/MSP environment. 

To estimate the frequency over a short interval, the signal is divided into overlapping buffers and transformed into the frequency domain using the Fourier transform (FT). Once transformed, frequency content can be manipulated and restored to the time domain. Essentially, a multichannel buffer is used to hold overlapping frames of data, with write pointers separated by the ```hop_size```, for buffers that have length ```buffer_size```. When the write pointer reaches the end of the buffer the corresponding channel contents are transformed, manipulated and transform-inverted. This recipe was not found by the developers and we hope this short description is useful for future audio programmers.

### Spectral Freeze

The phase vocodeur is capable of many effects. Its ability to dilate signals in time without changing pitch content is the effect extended in this plug-in. Time stretching is accomplished by phase interpolation, explored in Puckette (1995). In real-time this effect can only be used to slow down a signal. What happens should the speed be slowed to zero?

This effect is the spectral freeze, whereby a single temporal unit is held and used to synthesize the frequencies that made up that unit. Naively, we may choose to use only a single temporal slice and its magnitude information is enough to synthesize the frequencies necessary for this effect. But in reality should we do this with a frame of $N$ samples, the sound we synthesize by definition of the FT will have period $N$. When implemented this sounds like the frequency content of the frame effected by frequency modulation where $f_m = 1/N$. 

This hardly sounds like the desired sound. To create a more natural sound, the phase difference between the last two frames is calculated and a running sum is taken to advance the phase of the synthesized sound.

## Behind the Curtain
_Stutter+Hold_ is developed by Max Henry and Julian Vanasse for the AES Student Competition: MATLAB Plugin. Prior to starting this project both had not yet programmed a real-time time-frequency processing system from the ground up and this competition served as a pretext for developing such a tool. For interested parties the developers will soon release the ```AnalysisSynthesis``` framework they built for spectral processing.
